        <h1>SHABBAT</h1>
        <p>Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, is a sacred day of rest and spiritual rejuvenation that begins at sundown on Friday and ends at nightfall on Saturday. It is observed by abstaining from work, lighting candles, reciting blessings, and attending synagogue services. Shabbat rituals include a festive meal, often featuring challah bread and wine, and spending quality time with family and friends. The day is marked by prayer, study, and reflection, providing a time to disconnect from the material world and connect with God, community, and loved ones. Shabbat is considered a cornerstone of Jewish life, fostering spiritual renewal and communal bonds.</p>

        <h1>History about Shabbat</h1>
        <p>Shabbat, rooted in the biblical account of God resting on the seventh day of Creation, has been observed by Jews for millennia. Its practices evolved over time, influenced by biblical injunctions and rabbinic interpretations. In the Exodus narrative, Shabbat is commanded as a day of rest and remembrance of liberation from slavery in Egypt. Throughout Jewish history, Shabbat has served as a cornerstone of communal and familial life, preserving Jewish identity and values. Its observance varies among different Jewish denominations and communities, but the essence remains: a day of spiritual renewal, communal worship, and rest from the labors of the week.

        <h1>More about Shabbat</h1>
        <p>In Jewish homes, a number of preparations are made before Shabbat. The house is tidied and food is prepared, and two candles are placed on the dining table. These represent the two commandments received by Moses on Mount Sinai related to Shabbat, which were to “remember” and “observe” the SabbathAlso on the table will be two loaves of challah breadto represent the food God provided for the Jews when they were walking through the desert in flight from Egypt.
            <br></br>
            On Friday evening the Shabbat is welcomed with the lighting of the two candles. Traditionally, the mother of the family places her hands over her eyes and recites a blessing to welcome Shabbat. The family may visit the synagogue. Depending on the time of the service, this could be before their meal or after. They eat a meal together as a family on Friday evening. Before any food is eaten, blessings are said for the children, and kiddush is said over the wine to make Shabbat holy. Drinking wine on Shabbat shows that this is a joyful, celebratory time. The bread (challah) is blessed and everyone takes a piece. Typically, the meal lasts for a few hours with everyone enjoying family time, often singing songs and telling religious stories.On Saturday, after visiting the synagogue, the family shares another meal. The afternoon is spent studying the Torah and playing games as a family.</p>
